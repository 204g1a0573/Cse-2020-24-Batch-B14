## Title : Student placement prediction using machine learning
### Abstract :
*The aim of this project is to analyze the standards of students and to predict the possibility of placement. It’s a student assessment on the basis of his academic skills, innovations, research and development capabilities. Doing this can help students as well as academics to boost students standards. Also it helps us to design our course and extra training on the basis of it for maximum benefit to students. 
	Creating a dataset for this is not easy because motivating students to share their information is a challenging task. For the prediction of placement possibility we use the dataset prepared from the survey and different types of Naive Bayes Algorithm, which is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the most effective and simplest algorithms to implement for supervised labeled dataset.*
